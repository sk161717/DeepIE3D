# Frontend part of DeepIE3D

Frontend capable of displaying 3D models made with DeepIE3D. Connected to the backend, you'll be able to perform interactive evolutionary 3D modelling. 

The source code is ready to be transpiled into JavaScript - the only thing to change is the URL to the backend in [http_service.dart](lib/services/http_service.dart).
