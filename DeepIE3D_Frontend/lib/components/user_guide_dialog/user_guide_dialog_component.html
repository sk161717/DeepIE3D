            <p>This browser-based tool let's you create beautiful 3D models without even modelling them!</p>
            <p>
                Whether you need models for concept development, computer games, 3D printing or purely for fun, this
                will do the trick.
            </p>
            <p>
                In DeepIE3D, there're two ways of reaching your desired 3D model: The regular approach, called "Normal
                Mode", and the custom approach, called "Advanced Mode".
            </p>
            <h3>General Principles</h3>
            <p>
                In each iteration of 3D modelling, you're presented with nine 3D models from a certain domain (e.g.
                planes or chairs).
                These models are evolved troughout the process - when you're satisfied with one or more of the models,
                you're done. During the process, you'll always have the following possibilities:
            </p>
            <ul class="bullet-less">
                <li>
                    <div class="icon-legend">

                            Force novelty in models: Widens the distribution of newly created models, resulting in more
                            different models (experimential feature, turned off for now)
                        </p>

            <h3>Normal Mode</h3>
            <p>
                This is the default mode. It utilizes the original DeepIE algorithm to evolve chosen models. This
                involves mutating, combining and generating new models. In this mode, in addition to the general
                possibilities, you're able to perform the following actions:
            </p>
            <ul class="bullet-less">
                <li>
                    <div class="icon-legend">
                        <material-icon class="icon-description" icon="favorite_border">
                        </material-icon>
                        <p>Mark a model as a candidate to the DeepIE algorithm</p>
                    </div>
                </li>
            </ul>
            <h3>Advanced Mode</h3>
            <p>
                As the name states, this is the advanced mode as it let's you custimize the next evolutionary iteration
                completely. Each evolutionary iteration consists of a generation of nine models. How these nine model
                look is fully based on the evolution they undergo - you decide. In addition to the general
                possibilities, you're able to perform the following actions:
            </p>
            <ul class="bullet-less">
                <li>
                    <div class="icon-legend">
                        <material-icon class="icon-description" icon="lock">
                        </material-icon>
                        <p>Mark a model as being kept in its original form in the next evolutionary iteration</p>
                    </div>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <div class="icon-legend">
                        <material-icon class="icon-description" icon="shuffle">
                        </material-icon>
                        <p>Mark a model as being combined with another to-be-chosen model in the next
                            evolutionary iteration</p>
                    </div>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <div class="icon-legend">
                        <material-icon class="icon-description" icon="tune">
                        </material-icon>
                        <p>Mark a model as being mutated in the next evolutionary iteration</p>
                    </div>
                </li>
            </ul>
            <p>
                To keep track of the next generation of nine models, you'll be able to see the upcoming evolutions to
                the right - if you dislike one, you can remove it. Additionally, you'll be able to keep track of how
                a certain model contributes to the next evolutionary iteration by observing the icons in its top left
                corner.
